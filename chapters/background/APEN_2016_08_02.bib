abstract = {A novel method is proposed for designing an energy storage system (ESS) which is dedicated to the reduction of the uncertainty of short-term wind power forecasts up to 48 h. The investigation focuses on the statistical behavior of the forecast error and the state of charge (SOC) of the ESS. This approach gives an insight into the influence of the forecast conditions (horizon, quality) on the distribution of SOC. With this knowledge, an optimized sizing of the ESS can be done with a well-defined uncertainty limit. For this study, one-year time series of power output measurements and forecasts were available for two wind farms. As a reference, different forecast quality degrees are simulated based on a persistence approach. With the forecast data, empirical probability density functions (pdfs) are generated which are the basis of the proposed method. This approach can lead to a considerable reduction of the ESS and provides important information about the unserved energy. This unserved energy represents the remaining forecast uncertainty. As a consequence, the proposed probabilistic method permits the sizing of energy storage systems as a function of the desired remaining forecast uncertainty, reducing simultaneously power and energy capacity.},

abstract = {The variable output of a large wind farm presents many integration challenges, especially at high levels of penetra- tion. The uncertainty in the output of a large wind plant can be cov- ered by using fast-acting dispatchable sources, such as natural gas turbines or hydro generators. However, using dispatchable sources on short notice to smooth the variability of wind power can increase the cost of large-scale wind power integration. To remedy this, the inclusion of large-scale energy storage at the wind farm output can be used to improve the predictability of wind power and reduce the need for load following and regulation hydro or fossil-fuel reserve generation. This paper presents sizing and control methodologies for a zinc–bromine flow battery-based energy storage system. The results show that the power flow control strategy does have a sig- nificant impact on proper sizing of the rated power and energy of the system. In particular, artificial neural network control strate- gies resulted in significantly lower cost energy storage systems than simplified controllers. The results show that through more effec- tive control and coordination of energy storage systems, the pre- dictability of wind plant outputs can be increased and the cost of integration associated with reserve requirements can be decreased.},

abstract = {Ambitious targets for renewable power production have been defined for the electric power systems in Europe. The accomplishment of these targets requires the increase in renewable energy production, namely from wind power generation. However, the intermittent nature of wind creates several problems to the power system operation and new approaches based on the combined use of wind power and energy storage technologies need to be developed. In this paper, the concept of the combined use of wind power production and hydro storage/production is exploited, through the development of an operational optimisation approach applied to a wind generator park with little water storage ability. The optimisation model defines the operational strategy to be followed for the hours ahead by a pump station and an hydraulic generator embedded in a wind/hydro pumping facility, using the Portuguese energy remuneration rules. The proposed methodology leads to considerable yearly profits for the wind generator production. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This analysis evaluates several operational benefits of electricity storage, including load-leveling, spinning contingency reserves, and regulation reserves. Storage devices were simulated in a utility system in the western United States, and the operational costs of generation was compared to the same system without the added storage. This operational value of storage was estimated for devices of various sizes, providing different services, and with several sensitivities to fuel price and other factors. Overall, the results followed previous analyses that demonstrate relatively low value for load-leveling but greater value for provision of reserve services. The value was estimated by taking the difference in operational costs between cases with and without energy storage and represents the operational cost savings from deploying storage by a traditional vertically integrated utility. The analysis also estimated the potential revenues derived from a merchant storage plant in a restructured market, based on marginal system prices. Due to suppression of on-/off-peak price differentials and incomplete capture of system benefits (such as the cost of power plant starts), the revenue obtained by storage in a market setting appears to be substantially less than the net benefit provided to the system. This demonstrates some of the additional challenges for storage deployed in restructured energy markets.},

This company is comprised of several cascaded hydro plants along a river basin as well as a pumped-storage plant. Due to existence of a suitable zone as a natural reservoir, it is assumed that the hydro generating company has constructed a pumped-storage plant using the mentioned natural zone as upper reservoir and one of its hydro dams as lower reservoir. The goal is maximizing the profit of company through participating in the day-ahead energy and ancillary service markets. In order to reach this goal, it is essential to have an appropriate approach to self-schedule of company. The spinning reserve and regulation markets are considered as ancillary services in which the company can participate. The self-scheduling problem of hydro generating company is therefore formulated and solved as a mixed integer non-linear programming (MINLP) problem.

Each component can be used to quantify the maximum energy storage requirement for different types of energy storage. This requirement is the physical limit that could be theoretically accommodated by a power system. The actual energy storage capacity can be further quantified within this limit by the cost-benefit analysis (future work). The proposed approach has been successfully used in a study conducted for the 2030 Western Electricity Coordinating Council system model. Some results of this study are provided in this paper.},

-Estimates the impact which large-scale storage would have on arbitrage value; i.e. reassessing the price-taker assumption- this is done by creating monthly regressions and evaluating them as a convex quadratic program- results in behavior other than bang-bang operations
-Because the storage shifts prices, there is a decrease in producer surplus and increase in consumer surplus on-peak (vica versa off-peak); this is roughly the same size as the operator's storage profits
-May be worht checking out the appendix


Critiques:
-Assumes linear price-load relationship in order to make the problem quadratic
-Does not examine ancillary services
Does not examine the relation between geography and welfare effects
-Does not fully examine the market structure implications of the welfare gains and what incentives may be necessary to appropriately incentivize},

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to the problem of optimal sizing of energy storage required for compensation of wind farm generation variability. Using wind farm production data from the BPA, we assess the effect of forecast quality and economic dispatch timing on the size of storage and critical power rat- ing required to nearly perfectly match the committed energy. We develop a Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) based operational model following NERC standard recommendations. Different forecasts are considered and compared from the storage sizing perspective. The results of our simulations can be fit by two simple relations, connecting the storage sizing with forecast error, wind variability, and the timescales of scheduling. A more ac- curate forecast reduces the storage sizing. However, diminishing returns are observed when the forecast error becomes comparable to natural wind variability within the commitment time interval. The proposed methodology can be extended to other systems with intermittent generation and controllable real or virtual storage.},
annote = {Studying storage to minimize error in the output of a wind farm relative to commited power.

Overall comments:
Better conducted than other studies I've seen, but some major gaps and poor figures weaken findings.

Summary:
Ran sequential runs to examind impact of storage system capacity (E{\&}P) on error. Shows asymptotic decrease in error, Minimizes error by adjusting the size of the storage system. 

Considers two forecast models: adding gaussian noise to curent hour, and using a linear fit based on current hour. Runs MPC for control sequence. Gaussian noise produced a more realistic forecast, and better reduction in error than the "persistence" forecast.


Critiques:
-artificial model of wind/storage linkage; could also satisfy with DR or detached storage
-Does not examine the actual cost of the storage to examine how economically feasible this is.
-Does not examine other functions that the storage system could provide (ancillary services)
-Postulates an E{\_}cap* at which increases in storage capacity do not have an impact on RMS power error, but does not demonstrate this for large prediction errors, or call out these asymptotic values or pareto points.
-Shows an asymptotic P{\_}cap* at which increases in power capacity also do not 
-Does not fully investigate the relation between commitment length and sizing of torage
-Really bad figures- no legends on many of the figures!

Key ideas:
-Increasing storage size and power capacity has diminishing returns, and may eventually have zero returns -{\textgreater} there is a maximal size
-Net size of storage needs to compensate both forecast error and natural variability
-Finds that the size of the storage system per unit total error scales linearly with the commitment length},
