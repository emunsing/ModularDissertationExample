\section{Introduction and Motivation}

Despite extensive use in financial applications to achieve consensus between non-trusting parties \cite{Killeen2015}, blockchains have seen limited deployment in the energy space \cite{DeutscheEnergie-AgenturGmbHdena2016} and have not been considered for coordinating DERs to manage network constraints \cite{Bonneau2015}.

We structure the remainder of the paper as follows: Section \ref{sec:blockchain} provides a brief overview of blockchains and smart contracts. Section \ref{sec:litreview} provides a survey of previous literature on dispatch of DERs in microgrids, decentralized optimization techniques, and blockchain use in energy applications. Section \ref{sec:formulation} presents the formulation of the optimal power flow problem.

\section{Prior Literature}
\label{sec:litreview}

As discussed in \cite{Ton2012}, 
Microgrids are electricity networks may operate in both grid-connected and self-sufficient modes. Surveys of approaches to microgrid management can be found in \cite{AhmadKhan2016,Minchala-Avila2015}. Decentralized algorithms have been explored for coordinating electric vehicles \cite{LeFloch2016,LeFloch2016a}, smart inverters \cite{Sondermeijer2016}, and for fleets of diverse DERs \cite{Mhanna2016,Tsai2015,Wang2016}.

\section{Optimal Dispatch Formulation}
\label{sec:formulation}

The distribution network is modeled as an undirected radial graph $\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{N},\mathcal{E})$, consisting of a set of nodes $\mathcal{N}$ and a set of distribution lines (a.k.a. edges) $\mathcal{E}$ connecting these nodes. Using the notation described in \cite{Li2015c}, we index the nodes in $\mathcal{N}$ by $i = 0, 1, \dots, n$, where node $0$ represents the root node (substation) and other nodes in $\mathcal{N}$ represent branch nodes. We also denote a line in $\mathcal{E}$ by the pair $(i, j)$ of nodes it connects where $j$ is closer to the feeder $0$. We call $j$ the parent of $i$, denoted by $\pi(i)$, and call $i$ the child of $j$. Denote the child set of j as $\delta(j):=\{i:(i,j)\in \mathcal{E}\}$. Thus a link $(i, j)$ can be denoted as $(i, \pi(i))$. 

\begin{subequations}\label{eqn:distflow}
\begin{align}
p_i &= P_i -\sum_{k\in\delta(i)}P_{k} + \text{r}_{i}l_{i}, \quad i=0,\dots,n \label{eq:pf1}\\
q_i &= Q_i -\sum_{k\in\delta(i)}Q_{k} + \text{x}_{i}l_{i}, \quad i=0,\dots,n \label{eq:pf2}\\
v_i &= v_{\pi(i)}+ 2(\text{r}_{i}P_{i} +\text{x}_{i}Q_{i}) - (\text{r}_{i}^2 + \text{x}_{i}^2)l_{i}, i=1,\dots,n  \label{eq:pf3}\\
l_{i} &= \frac{P_{i}^2 + Q_{i}^2}{v_i}, \quad i=1,\dots,n  \label{eq:noncvxbranchflow}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $S_0=0+\mathbf{i}0$ at the slack bus. Equations in \eqref{eqn:distflow} define a system in the variables $(P,Q,l,v):=(P_i,Q_i,l_i,v_i, \ \forall \ $i$ \ \in \mathcal{N})$, which do not include phase angles of voltages and currents. Given $(P,Q,l,v)$, phase angles can be uniquely determined for radial networks \cite{Farivar2013}.
