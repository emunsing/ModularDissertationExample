In particular, we provide sufficient conditions on the graph topology to tolerate a bounded number of adversaries in the neighborhood of every non-adversarial node, and necessary and sufficient conditions to tolerate a globally bounded number of adversaries. For situations where there are up to F adversaries in the neighborhood of every node, we use the concept of maximal F-local sets of graphs to provide lower bounds on the distance-to-optimality of achievable solutions under any algorithm. We show that finding the size of such sets is NP-hard.},

In this paper, a robust decentralized secondary frequency control design for islanded microgrids is developed to enable resilient coordination and integration of distributed energy resources (DERs). We cast the control problem centrally under steady state and adopt the feedback-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm for solving the decentralized control updates. The ADMM algorithm uses measurements at various points in the system to solve for control signals. Measurements and control commands are sent over communication networks such as Ethernet-based local area networks in the IEC 61850 standard. To enhance the robustness to cyber intrusions, we modify the ADMM algorithm using the Round-Robin technique to detect malicious DERs. As a complementary defense, an agreement algorithm based on a fast computation of Kirchhoff law conditions is implemented for continuously detecting false measurements. The results are demonstrated through simulation for a representative microgrid topology.},

Particularly in a decentralized environment, some computing units may behave abnormally, or even exhibit Byzantine failures---arbitrary and potentially adversarial behavior. In this paper, we develop distributed learning algorithms that are provably robust against such failures, with a focus on achieving optimal statistical performance. A main result of this work is a sharp analysis of two robust distributed gradient descent algorithms based on median and trimmed mean operations, respectively. We prove statistical error rates for three kinds of population loss functions: strongly convex, non-strongly convex, and smooth non-convex. In particular, these algorithms are shown to achieve order-optimal statistical error rates for strongly convex losses. To achieve better communication efficiency, we further propose a median-based distributed algorithm that is provably robust, and uses only one communication round. For strongly convex quadratic loss, we show that this algorithm achieves the same optimal error rate as the robust distributed gradient descent algorithms.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of distributed statistical machine learning in adversarial settings, where some unknown and time-varying subset of working machines may be compromised and behave arbitrarily to prevent an accurate model from being learned. This setting captures the potential adversarial attacks faced by Federated Learning -- a modern machine learning paradigm that is proposed by Google researchers and has been intensively studied for ensuring user privacy. Formally, we focus on a distributed system consisting of a parameter server and {\$}m{\$} working machines. Each working machine keeps {\$}N/m{\$} data samples, where {\$}N{\$} is the total number of samples. The goal is to collectively learn the underlying true model parameter of dimension {\$}d{\$}. In classical batch gradient descent methods, the gradients reported to the server by the working machines are aggregated via simple averaging, which is vulnerable to a single Byzantine failure. In this paper, we propose a Byzantine gradient descent method based on the geometric median of means of the gradients. We show that our method can tolerate {\$}q \backslashle (m-1)/2{\$} Byzantine failures, and the parameter estimate converges in {\$}O(\backslashlog N){\$} rounds with an estimation error of {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}d(2q+1)/N{\}}{\$}, hence approaching the optimal error rate {\$}\backslashsqrt{\{}d/N{\}}{\$} in the centralized and failure-free setting. The total computational complexity of our algorithm is of {\$}O((Nd/m) \backslashlog N){\$} at each working machine and {\$}O(md + kd \backslashlog{\^{}}3 N){\$} at the central server, and the total communication cost is of {\$}O(m d \backslashlog N){\$}. We further provide an application of our general results to the linear regression problem. A key challenge arises in the above problem is that Byzantine failures create arbitrary and unspecified dependency among the iterations and the aggregated gradients. We prove that the aggregated gradient converges uniformly to the true gradient function.},

abstract = {Deregulation of energy markets, penetration of renewables, advanced metering capabilities, and the urge for situational awareness, all call for system-wide power system state estimation (PSSE). Implementing a centralized estimator though is practically infeasible due to the complexity scale of an interconnection, the communication bottleneck in real-time monitoring, regional disclosure policies, and reliability issues. In this context, distributed PSSE methods are treated here under a unified and systematic framework. A novel algorithm is developed based on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It leverages existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies, exhibits low communication load, and its convergence to the centralized estimates is guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework accommodates a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links to the compressive sampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the state and identifies corrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are numerically evaluated using the IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4200-bus benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate that the attainable accuracy can be reached within a few inter-area exchanges, while largest residual tests are outperformed.},

abstract = {In the distributed optimization, multiple agents aim to minimize the average of all local cost functions cor- responding to one decision variable. Recently, the resilient algorithms for distributed optimization against attacks have received some attention, where it is assumed that the maximum number of tolerable attacks is strictly limited by the network connectivity. To relax this assumption, in this paper, we propose a resilient distribution optimization algorithm by exploiting the trusted agents, which cannot be compromised by adversary attacks. We prove that local variables of all normal agents can converge under the proposed algorithm if the trusted agents induce the connected dominating set of the original network. Furthermore, we exploit that the final solution of normal agents will converge to the convex optima set of the weighted average of all normal agents' local functions. We also show that the amount of tolerable adversary agents is not limited by the network connectivity under the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {We study the resilience to Byzantine failures of distributed implementations of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). So far, distributed machine learning frame-works have largely ignored the possibility of failures, especially arbitrary (i.e., Byzantine) ones. Causes of failures include software bugs, network asynchrony, biases in local datasets, as well as attackers trying to compromise the entire system. Assuming a set of n workers, up to f being Byzantine, we ask how resilient can SGD be, without limiting the dimension, nor the size of the parameter space. We first show that no gradient aggregation rule based on a linear combination of the vec-tors proposed by the workers (i.e, current approaches) tolerates a single Byzantine failure. We then formulate a resilience property of the aggregation rule capturing the basic requirements to guarantee convergence despite f Byzantine workers. We propose Krum, an aggregation rule that satisfies our resilience property, which we argue is the first provably Byzantine-resilient algorithm for distributed SGD. We also report on experimental evaluations of Krum.},

abstract = {The modern power system is undergoing a transformative shift from the classical electricity grid to a smart grid. There are four components in a smart grid, namely, smart power generation, smart transmission, smart distribution, and smart end use. Among them, the smart home technique controls the energy consumption of each end user, also known as customer, which potentially impacts the energy generation, transmission, and distribution.The smart home infrastructure features the automatic control of various interconnected modern home appliances. Together with the salient scheduling algorithms, it enables the customers to schedule the energy consumption, thus avoiding using electricity energy during the peak hours. This results in the reduction of electricity bill from the customer's perspective and improved balance of the energy load from the utility's perspective. The aforementioned process involves the usage of guideline pricing which estimates the future electricity price added by smart home controller. Despite its effectiveness, the smart home system is vulnerable to malicious cyberattacks. A hacker can manipulate the received guideline price and mislead the schedulers to make wrong decisions of energy scheduling. This can impact the bills of the customers and the peak energy usage of the power system. This chapter presents the state-of-the-art research on the smart home scheduling technique, explores the vulnerability of the smart home infrastructure, and describes the recent development of detection technologies against those cyberattacks.},

abstract = {State estimation (SE) plays an essential role in the monitoring and supervision of power systems. In today's power systems, SE is typically done in a centralized or in a hierarchical way, but as power systems will be increasingly interconnected in the future smart grid, distributed SE will become an important alternative to centralized and hierarchical solutions. As the future smart grid may rely on distributed SE, it is essential to understand the potential vulnerabilities that distributed SE may have. In this paper, we show that an attacker that compromises the communication infrastructure of a single control center in an interconnected power system can successfully perform a denial-of-service attack against state-of-the-art distributed SE, and consequently, it can blind the system operators of every region. As a solution to mitigate such a denial-of-service attack, we propose a fully distributed algorithm for attack detection. Furthermore, we propose a fully distributed algorithm that identifies the most likely attack location based on the individual regions' beliefs about the attack location, isolates the identified region, and then reruns the distributed SE. We validate the proposed algorithms on the IEEE 118 bus benchmark power system.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. We consider a micro-grid architecture that is distributed in nature and reliant on renewable energy. In standard grid architectures, demand management is handled via scheduling protocols that are centrally coordinated. Centralised approaches are however computationally intensive, thus not suited to distributed grid architectures with limited computational power. We address this problem with a decentralised scheduling algorithm. In our scheduling algorithm, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to decompose the scheduling problem into smaller sub problems that are solved in parallel over local computation devices, which yields an optimal solution. We show that ADMM can be used to model a scheduling solution that handles both decentralised and fully decentralised cases. As a further step, we show that false data injection attacks can be provoked by compromising parts of the communication infrastructure or a set of computing devices. In this case, the algorithm fails to converge to an optimum or converges toward a value that lends the attacker an advantage, and impacts the scheduling scheme negatively.},

This office might seem no different than any other geeky workplace, but in fact it's the front line of a war— a cyberwar, where most battles play out not in remote jungles or deserts but in suburban office parks like this one. As a senior researcher for Kaspersky Lab, a leading computer security firm based in Moscow, Roel Schouwenberg spends his days (and many nights) here at the lab's U.S. headquarters in Woburn, Mass., battling the most insidious digital weapons ever, capable of crippling water supplies, power plants, banks, and the very infrastructure that once seemed invulnerable to attack. Computer cables snake Recognition of such threats exploded in June 2010 with the discovery of Stuxnet, a 500-kilobyte computer worm that infected the software of at least 14 industrial sites in Iran, including a uranium-enrichment plant. Although a computer virus relies on an unwitting victim to install it, a spreads on its own, often over a computer network. worm (http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/how-to-hook-worms) This worm was an unprecedentedly masterful and malicious piece of code that attacked in three phases. First, it targeted Microsoft Windows machines and networks, repeatedly replicating itself. Then it sought out Siemens Step7 software, which is also Windows-based and used to program industrial control systems that operate equipment, such as centrifuges. Finally, it compromised the programmable logic controllers. The worm's authors could thus spy on the industrial systems and even cause the fast-spinning centrifuges to tear themselves apart, unbeknownst to the human operators at the plant. (Iran has not confirmed reports that Stuxnet destroyed some of its centrifuges.) Stuxnet could spread stealthily between computers running Windows—even those not connected to the Internet. If a worker stuck a USB thumb drive into an infected machine, Stuxnet could, well, worm its way onto it, then spread onto the next machine that read that USB drive. Because someone could unsuspectingly infect a machine this way, letting the worm proliferate over local area networks, experts feared that the malware had perhaps gone wild across the world. In October 2012, U.S. defense secretary Leon Panetta that the United States was vulnerable to a " cyber Pearl Harbor " that could derail trains, poison water supplies, and cripple power grids. The next month, Chevron confirmed the speculation by becoming the first U.S. corporation to admit that Stuxnet had spread across its machines.},

We use the concept of interface variables to capture the interactions between control and platform layers, and quantitatively model the relation among system security, performance, and schedulability via interface variables.

The optimal scheduling problem is modeled to minimize the coalitional operation cost of the IMG, including the fuel cost of conventional distributed generators and the life loss cost of BESSs. By using the framework of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a distributed optimal scheduling model and an iteration solution algorithm for the IMG is introduced; only the expected exchanging power (EEP) of each MG is required during the iterations. Furthermore, a privacy-preserving strategy for the sharing of the EEP among MGs is designed to work with the mechanism of the distributed algorithm. According to the security analysis, the EEP can be delivered in a cooperative and privacy-preserving way.

Specifically, novel formulations for the optimization problem that provide a flexible design of the trade-off between performance and false alarm are proposed. In addition, the centralized case is extended to a distributed framework for both the estimation and attack problems. Different distributed scenarios are proposed depending on assumptions that lead to the spreading of the resources, network nodes and players. Consequently, for each of the presented frameworks a corresponding optimization problem is introduced jointly with an algorithm to solve it.

abstract = {A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power generators to consumers through power transmission and distribution networks across a large geographical area. System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, and $\backslash$textit{\{} state estimation {\}} is used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, including $\backslash$textit{\{} interacting bad measurements {\}} introduced by $\backslash$textit{\{} arbitrary, nonrandom causes {\}}. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measuremtns injected by attackers. $\backslash$par In this aricle, we expose an unknown vulernability of existing bad measurement detection algorithms by presenting and analyzing a new class of attacks, called $\backslash$textit{\{} false data injection attacks {\}}, against state estimation in electric power grids. Under the assumption that the attacker can access the current power system configuration information and manipulate the measurements of meters at physically protected locations such as substations, such attacks can introduce $\backslash$textit{\{} arbitrary {\}} errors into certain state variables without being detected by existing algorithms. Moreover, we look at two scenarios, where the attacker is either constrained to specific meters or limited in the resources required to compromise meters. We show that the attacker can systematically and efficiently construct attack vectors in both scenarios to change the results of state estimation in $\backslash$textit{\{} arbitrary ways {\}}. We also extend these attacks to $\backslash$textit{\{} generalized false data injection attacks {\}}, which can further increase the impact by exploiting measurement errors typically tolerated in state estimation. We demonstrate the success of these attacks through simulation using IEEE test systems, and also discuss the practicality of these attacks and the real-world constraintes that limit their effectiveness.},

abstract = {With rapid advances in sensor, computer and communication networks, modern power systems have become complicated cyber-physical systems. Assessing and enhancing cyber-physical system security is therefore of utmost importance for the future electricity grid. In a successful false data injection attack (FDIA), an attacker compromises measurements from grid sensors in such a way that undetected errors are introduced into estimates of state variables such as bus voltage angles and magnitudes. In evading detection by commonly employed residue-based bad data detection tests, FDIAs are capable of severely threatening power system security. Since the first published research on FDIAs in 2009, research into FDIA-based cyber-attacks has been extensive. This paper gives a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art in FDIAs against modern power systems. The paper first summarizes the theoretical basis of FDIAs, and then discusses both the physical and economic impacts of a successful FDIA. The paper presents the basic defense strategies against FDIAs, and discusses some potential future research directions in this field.},

In this paper, we develop a false data detection system that integrates two techniques that are tailored to the different attack types that we consider. We adopt anomaly-based detection to detect strong attacks that feature the injection of large amounts of spurious measurement data in a very short time. We integrate the anomaly detection mechanism with a watermarking-based detection scheme that prevents more stealthy attacks that involve subtle manipulation of the measure- ment data. We conduct a theoretical analysis to derive the closed-form formulae for the performance metrics that allow us to investigate the effectiveness of our proposed detection techniques.

We show how an attack could systematically construct a profitable attacking strategy, in the meantime being undetected by the system operator.

We consider several general attacks, in which the adversary may manipulate the quantity of energy supply, the quantity of energy response, and the link state of energy transmission. The forged data injected by those attacks will cause imbalanced demand and supply, increase the cost for energy distribution, and disrupt the energy distribution. We formally model these attacks and quantitatively analyze their impact on energy distribution. Our evaluation data show that those attacks can effectively disrupt the effectiveness of energy distribution process, causing significant supplied energy loss, energy transmission cost and the number of outage users.},

The model leads to a new approach to solving optimal power flow (OPF) that consists of two relaxation steps. The first step eliminates the voltage and current angles and the second step approximates the resulting problem by a conic program that can be solved efficiently. For radial networks, we prove that both relaxation steps are always exact, provided there are no upper bounds on loads. For mesh networks, the conic relaxation is always exact but the angle relaxation may not be exact, and we provide a simple way to determine if a relaxed solution is globally optimal. We propose convexification of mesh networks using phase shifters so that OPF for the convexified network can always be solved efficiently for an optimal solution. We prove that convexification requires phase shifters only outside a spanning tree of the network and their placement depends only on network topology, not on power flows, generation, loads, or operating constraints.

We define two types of flexible loads: (i) deferrable loads that have a fixed power profile but can be deferred in time and (ii) shapeable loads that have flexible power profiles but fixed energy requests, such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). The proposed method uses a hierarchical control scheme based on a model predictive control (MPC) formulation for minimizing the global system cost. The first stage computes a reachable reference that trades off deviation from the nominal voltage with the required generation control. The second stage uses a price-based objective to aggregate flexible loads and provide load shaping services, while satisfying system constraints and users' preferences at all times. It is shown that the proposed controller is recursively feasible under specific conditions, i.e. the flexible load demands are satisfied and bus voltages remain within the desired limits. Finally, the proposed scheme is illustrated on a 55 bus radial distribution network.},

abstract = {We formulate the control of reactive power generation by photovoltaic inverters in a power distribution circuit as a constrained optimization that aims to minimize power losses subject to finite inverter capacity and upper and lower voltage limits at all nodes in the circuit.

Moreover, the cost function is separable enabling a distributed online implementation with node-local computations using only local measurements augmented with limited information from the neighboring nodes communicated over cyber channels. Such an approach lies between the fully centralized and local policy approaches previously considered. We explore protocols based on the dual-ascent method and on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMMs), and find that the ADMM protocol performs significantly better.},

abstract = {Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is an important tool used to coordinate assets in electric power systems to ensure customer voltages are within pre-defined tolerances and to improve distribution system operations. While convex relaxations of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems have been proposed for both balanced and unbalanced networks, these approaches do not provide universal convexity guarantees and scale inefficiently as network size and the number of constraints increase. To address these issues, we have recently explored a novel linearized OPF formulation for unbalanced distribution systems. Our approach is made possible in part by approximating the ratio of voltages across phases throughout the network. In this work, we generalize the previous formulation to allow arbitrary complex numbers to approximate voltage ratios at different locations in the feeder. Furthermore, we continue the analysis of the linearized OPF via comparison to results obtained through convex relaxations and Semi-Definite Programming (SDP). Simulations of IEEE test feeders show that the proposed formulation produces control decisions that closely approximate those obtained via SDP relaxations. In a specific case, we show that the linearized OPF is capable of solving certain problems which cannot be formulated as SDPs.},

abstract = {Smart devices, storage and other distributed technologies have the potential to greatly improve the utilisation of network infrastructure and renewable generation. Decentralised control of these technologies overcomes many scalability and privacy concerns, but in general still requires the underlying problem to be convex in order to guarantee convergence to a global optimum. Considering that AC power flows are non-convex in nature, and the operation of household devices often requires discrete decisions, there has been uncertainty surrounding the use of distributed methods in a realistic setting. This paper extends prior work on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for solving the dynamic optimal power flow (D-OPF) problem. We utilise more realistic line and load models, and introduce a two-stage approach to managing discrete decisions and uncertainty. Our experiments on a suburb-sized microgrid show that this approach provides near optimal results, in a time that is fast enough for receding horizon control. This work brings distributed control of smart-grid technologies closer to reality.},

The primary aim of those instruments is to improve the operating efficiency of the regulated firms. Huge investments will be needed in the regulated network sectors.

abstract = {Optimal power flow (OPF) is considered for microgrids, with the objective of minimizing either the power distribution losses, or, the cost of power drawn from the substation and supplied by distributed generation (DG) units, while effecting voltage regulation. The microgrid is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers. The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing alternatives},

Since microgrids are expected to coexist with traditional power grids (such as district heating does with traditional heating systems), their planning process must be addressed to economic feasibility, as a long-term stability guarantee. Planning a microgrid is a complex process due to existing alternatives, goals, constraints and uncertainties. Usually planning goals conflict each other and, as a consequence, different optimization problems appear along the planning process. In this context, technical literature about optimization techniques applied to microgrid planning have been reviewed and the guidelines for innovative planning methodologies focused on economic feasibility can be defined. Finally, some trending techniques and new microgrid planning approaches are pointed out.},

DEM facilitates the minimization of the transmission and operation costs, peak load and environmental pollution.

The capability of fast restoration against physical/cyber attack, integration of renewable energy resources and information and communication technologies (ICT) make microgrid as an ideal candidate for distributed power systems. The energy management system of microgrid can perform real time energy forecasting of renewable resources, energy storage elements and controllable loads in making proper short term scheduling to minimize total operating costs. Cost benefit analysis of microgrid reveals that cooperation among different microgrids can play an important role in the reduction of import energy cost from the utility grid. Cooperation among microgrids in smart microgrid network (SMN) brings the energy sharing and management issues. In this paper we present a review of existing optimization objectives, constraints, solution approaches and tools used in microgrid energy management.

abstract = {A smart grid power system with renewable energy resources and distributed energy storage shows significant improvement in the power system's emission reduction, reliability, efficiency, and security. A microgrid is a smart grid in a small scale which can be stand-alone or grid-tied. Multi microgrids form a network with energy management and operational planning through two-way power flow and communication. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of a microgrid, a performance metric is proposed with consideration of the electricity price, emission, and service quality, each of them is given a weighting factor. Thus, the performance metric is flexible according to the consumers' preference. With the weighting factors set in this paper, this performance metric is further applied on microgrids operated as stand-alone, grid-tied, and networked. Each microgrid consists of a solar panel, a hydrogen fuel cell stack, an electrolyzer, a hydrogen storage tank, and a load. For a stand-alone system, the load prediction lowers down the daily electricity consumption about 5.7{\%}, the quantity of H2 stored fluctuates in a wide range, and overall performance indexes increase with the solar panel size. In a grid-tied MG, the load prediction has a significant effect on the daily consumed electricity which drops 25{\%} in 4 days, some day-time loads are shifted to the night time, and the capacity of hydrogen tank is lower than that in a stand-alone MG. In a network with multiple MGs, the control of the power distribution strongly affects the MG's performance. However, the overall performance index instead of any specific index increases with the MG's power generated from renewable energy resources. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, the regulatory framework for economic integration of muG and mugrids on distribution systems, despite being crucial, is still an open issue. The main purpose of this paper is to contribute for the development of an appropriate economic regulation framework that removes the barriers to muG and mugrid development. To do so, the relevant costs and benefits resulting from the establishment of muG and mugrid are identified and a methodology for sharing those costs and benefits among the involved economic agents is presented. The only pre-requisite of such a methodology is that a net benefit to all economic agents exists, which is the case most of the times. An illustrative example is included.},

abstract = {The concept of microgrid ($\mu$Grid) has been emerging as a way to integrate microgeneration ($\mu$G) in low-voltage (LV) networks and simultaneously improve its potential benefits. Technical requirements to connect $\mu$grids to LV networks have been studied in order to make this concept technologically feasible and safe to operate. However, the regulatory framework for economic integration of $\mu$G and $\mu$Grids on distribution systems, despite being crucial, is still an open issue. The main purpose of this paper is to contribute for the development of an appropriate economic regulation framework that removes the barriers to $\mu$G and $\mu$Grid development. To do so, the relevant costs and benefits resulting from the establishment of $\mu$G and $\mu$Grid are identified and a methodology for sharing those costs and benefits among the involved economic agents is presented. The only pre-requisite of such a methodology is the existence of a net benefit to all economic agents. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a fast distributed algorithm for aggregating a large number of households with a mixture of discrete and continuous energy levels. A distinctive feature of the method in this paper is that the nonconvex DR problem is decomposed in terms of house-holds as opposed to devices, which allows incorporating more intricate couplings between energy storage devices, appliances and distributed energy resources. The proposed method is a fast distributed algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted DR model. The method is tested on systems with up to 2560 households, each with 10 devices on average. The proposed algorithm is designed to terminate in 60 iterations irrespective of system size, which can be ideal for an on-line version of this problem. Moreover, numerical results show that with minimal parameter tuning, the algorithm exhibits a very similar convergence behavior throughout the studied systems and converges to near-optimal solutions, which corroborates its scalability. t g units of energy from the grid during time-slot t. c0 t Coefficient ({\$}) of the constant term in C t x t g during time-slot t. c1 t Coefficient ({\$}/kWh) of the linear term in C t x t g during time-slot t. c2 t Coefficient ({\$}/kWh 2) of the quadratic term in C t x t g during time-slot t.

The miners collectively build a tree of blocks, and they are paid when they create a node (mine a block) which will end up in the path of the tree that is adopted by all. Since the miners can hide newly mined nodes, they play a game with incomplete information. Here we consider two simplified forms of this game in which the miners have complete information. In the simplest game the miners release every mined block immediately, but are strategic on which blocks to mine. In the second more complicated game, when a block is mined it is announced immediately, but it may not be released so that other miners cannot continue mining from it. A miner not only decides which blocks to mine, but also when to release blocks to other miners. In both games, we show that when the computational power of each miner is relatively small, their best response matches the expected behavior of the bitcoin designer. However, when the computational power of a miner is large, he deviates from the expected behavior, and other Nash equilibria arise.},

abstract = {We rely on economic theory to discuss how blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will influence the rate and direction of innovation. We identify two key costs that are affected by distributed ledger technology: 1) the cost of verification; and 2) the cost of networking. Markets facilitate the voluntary exchange of goods and services between buyers and sellers. For an exchange to be executed, key attributes of a transaction need to be verified by the parties involved at multiple points in time. Blockchain technology, by allowing market participants to perform costless verification, lowers the costs of auditing transaction information, and allows new marketplaces to emerge. Furthermore, when a distributed ledger is combined with a native cryptographic token (as in Bitcoin), marketplaces can be bootstrapped without the need of traditional trusted intermediaries, lowering the cost of networking. This challenges existing revenue models and incumbents's market power, and opens opportunities for novel approaches to regulation, auctions and the provision of public goods, software, identity and reputation systems.},

abstract = {Nakamoto's famous blockchain protocol enables achieving consensus in a so-called permissionless setting—anyone can join (or leave) the protocol execution, and the protocol instructions do not depend on the identities of the players. His ingenious protocol prevents “sybil attacks” (where an adversary spawns any number of new players) by relying on computational puzzles (a.k.a. “moderately hard functions”) introduced by Dwork and Naor (Crypto'92). The analysis of the blockchain consensus protocol (a.k.a. Nakamoto consensus) has been a notoriously diﬃcult task. Prior works that analyze it either make the simplifying assumption that network channels are fully synchronous (i.e. messages are instantly delivered without delays) (Garay et al, Eurocrypt'15) or only consider speciﬁc attacks (Nakamoto'08; Sampolinsky and Zohar, FinancialCrypt'15); additionally, as far as we know, none of them deal with players joining or leaving the protocol. In this work we prove that the blockchain consensus mechanism satisﬁes a strong forms of consistency and liveness in an asynchronous network with adversarial delays that are a-priori bounded, within a formal model allowing for adaptive corruption and spawning of new players, assuming that the computational puzzle is modeled as a random oracle. (We complement this result by showing a simple attack against the blockchain protocol in a fully asynchronous setting, showing that the puzzle-hardness needs to be appropriately set as a function of the maximum network delay; this attack applies even for static corruption.) As an independent contribution, we deﬁne an abstract notion of a blockchain protocol and identify appropriate security properties of such protocols; we prove that Nakamoto's blockchain protocol satisﬁes them and that these properties are suﬃcient for typical applications; we hope that this abstraction may simplify further applications of blockchains.},

abstract = {CornellTech, Cornell, Initiative for CryptoCurrency and Contracts (IC3) * Abstract Consensus, or state machine replication is a foundational building block of distributed sys-tems and modern cryptography. Consensus in the classical, permissioned setting has been extensively studied in the 30 years of distributed systems literature. Recently developments in Bitcoin and other decentralized cryptocurrencies popularized a new form of consensus in a " permissionless " setting, where anyone can join and leave dynamically, and there is no a-priori knowledge of the consensus nodes. Despite this exciting breakthrough, today's permissionless consensus protocols, often referred to as " blockchains " , are known to have terrible performance, which has resulted in heated, and at times acrimonious debates in the community. We propose hybrid consensus, a method for bootstrapping fast permissionless consensus by combining an inefficient blockchain protocol with a fast permissioned consensus protocol. Hybrid consensus uses the blockchain not to agree on transactions, but to agree on rotating committees which in turn execute permissioned consensus protocols to agree on transactions. While the high-level idea is intuitive, formally instantiating and reasoning about the protocol exposed a multitude of non-trivial technical subtleties and challenges.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and the more recent Ethereum system allow users to specify scripts in transactions and con-tracts to support applications beyond simple cash transac-tions. In this work, we analyze the extent to which these systems can enforce the correct semantics of scripts. We show that when a script execution requires nontrivial com-putation effort, practical attacks exist which either waste miners' computational resources or lead miners to accept incorrect script results. These attacks drive miners to an ill-fated choice, which we call the verifier's dilemma, whereby rational miners are well-incentivized to accept unvalidated blockchains. We call the framework of computation through a scriptable cryptocurrency a consensus computer and de-velop a model that captures incentives for verifying com-putation in it. We propose a resolution to the verifier's dilemma which incentivizes correct execution of certain ap-plications, including outsourced computation, where scripts require minimal time to verify. Finally we discuss two dis-tinct, practical implementations of our consensus computer in real cryptocurrency networks like Ethereum.},
annote = {Very interesting. In scripting systems like Ethereum which have significant computational cost to verification, two types of attacks are possible depending on whether verifiers actually verify the transaction:
1) Resource exhaustion attack: A high-cost contract is submitted, along with a transaction which solves the problem. The attacker mines this, recovers the gas cost, and then broadcasts the mined block to the network and begins work on the next block. This slows down the network whenever verifiers are dilligent about verifying transactions, while the attacker is able to get ahead in mining the next block.
2) Incorrect transaction attack: If verifiers skip validation for high-computation blocks, invalid transactions can be integrated into the system, potentially allowing for double-spend or theft of assets.

I'm unclear how the incorrect transaction would actually be honored- at some point it seems that it would be identified and rejected when the system is updated.

Proposes two methods for dealing with this: either by breaking the problem up into a set of smaller problems, each of which is small enough that it will be validated by miners, and by sampling a random subset of the problem in the subsequent validation.},

It serves as a resource to utilities, regulators, and stakeholders who are interested in VOS program design and implementation. The report begins by characterizing solar markets under the VOS construct and assesses the economic viability of distributed solar projects under hypothetical VOS rate scenarios, for a wide variety of locations across the United States. This sets the groundwork for a discussion of specific VOS program design elements and decisions, such as how the VOS rate is applied, how VOS rate adjustments are made, and potential interactions with other solar incentives.},

abstract = {Compensation mechanisms for electricity generation systems installed behind the meter are under scrutiny in several jurisdictions in the United States. Legislators in 29 states introduced bills to amend net metering provisions in 2014, and in 33 states in the 2015 legislative session as of August 20, 2015. Some utilities have also sought to increase the revenue they receive from net-metered customers through rate redesign. The circumstances that have triggered the recent push for change include a growing percentage of net-metered customers, potential effects of distributed generation on cost allocation, decreasing photovoltaic (PV) system costs, the challenges of integrating high levels of solar generation in the distribution network, and increasing pressure on utility business models. This report presents a survey of options to charge and compensate PV customers, as well as options that may preserve utility revenues in scenarios with increased DG. These options could be used as building blocks to create a distributed generation (DG) compensation policy that may preserve the value of the different stakeholders and balance their interests.},

The commissioning consists of the device proving its manufacturing provenance in an anonymous fashion without reliance on a trusted third party, and for the device to be anonymously registered through the use of a blockchain system. We introduce the ChainAnchor architecture that provides device commissioning in a privacy-preserving fashion. The goal of ChainAnchor is (i) to support anonymous device commissioning, (ii) to support device-owners being remunerated for selling their device sensor-data to service providers, and (iii) to incentivize device-owners and service providers to share sensor-data in a privacy-preserving manner. {\textcopyright} 2016 ACM.},

@article{Watson2013,
abstract = {This study examines how fast automated demand response (AutoDR) can help mitigate grid balancing challenges introduced by upcoming increases in intermittent renewable generation resources such as solar and wind in an environmentally friendly and cost effective manner. This study gathers data from multiple sources to determine the total electric end-use loads in the commercial and industrial sectors of California. The shed capacity available from AutoDR in these sectors varies based on many factors including weather, time of year and time of day. This study estimates that the lowest shed capacity could occur on cold winter mornings and the highest on hot summer afternoons. Based on this analysis, a large-scale deployment of fast AutoDR could provide between 0.18 and 0.90 GW of DR-based ancillary services from the existing stock of commercial and industrial facilities throughout California. With modest investments to upgrade and expand use of automated control systems in commercial and industrial facilities the estimated shed potential could approximately double to between 0.42 and 2.07 GW. Deployed costs for fast AutoDR (installation, materials, labor and program management) are about 10{\%} of the deployed costs of grid scale battery storage. However, AutoDR in California has less capacity than what is required to meet the grid balancing challenges introduced by the 2020 renewable portfolio standard goals. There are many different types of ancillary services necessary to keep the electric grid in balance. Though AutoDR may not be suitable for all forms of ancillary services, the lower installed cost of AutoDR indicates that it should be considered for use in the time domains and capacities for which it is applicable. By combining AutoDR with traditional gas fired thermal generation and battery storage technologies, an optimal mix of generation, AutoDR and storage should be considered to meet upcoming challenges introduced by the increased use of renewable generation.},

We present two arbitrage approaches: 1) a benchmark that gives us an optimal policy but requires local computation or real-time communication and 2) an alternative based on a thermal energy storage model, which relies on less computation/communication infrastructure, but is suboptimal. We find that the alternative approach achieves around 60{\%}–80{\%} of the optimal wholesale energy cost savings. We use this approach to compute practical upper bounds for savings via arbitrage with air conditioners in California's intraday energy market. We investigate six sites over four years and find that the savings range from {\$}2–{\$}37 per TCL per year, and depend upon outdoor temperature statistics and price volatility.},

abstract = {Delaware. They are premised on different facts and different local conditions, but a common legal question justifies their consideration together in this consolidated opinion. [FN1] FN1. In the Kansas case, Brown v. Board of Education, the plaintiffs are Negro children of elementary school age residing in Topeka. They brought this action in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas to enjoin enforcement of a Kansas statute which permits, but does not require, cities of more than 15,000 population to maintain separate school facilities for Negro and white students. Kan.Gen.Stat.1949, s 72--1724. Pursuant to that authority, the Topeka Board of Education elected to establish segregated elementary schools. Other public schools in the community, however, are operated on a nonsegregated basis. The three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U.S.C. ss 2281 and 2284, 28 U.S.C.A. ss 2281, 2284, found that segregation in public education has a detrimental effect upon Negro children, but denied relief on the ground that the Negro and white schools were substantially equal with respect to buildings, transportation, curricula, and educational qualifications of teachers. 98 F.Supp. 797. The case is here on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. s 1253, 28 U.S.C.A. s 1253. In the South Carolina case, Briggs v. Elliott, the plaintiffs are Negro children of both elementary and high school age residing in Clarendon County. They brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools. S.C.Const. Art. XI, s 7; S.C.Code 1942, s 5377. The three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U.S.C. ss 2281 and 2284, 28 U.S.C.A. ss 2281, 2284, denied the requested relief. The court found that the Negro schools were inferior to the white schools and ordered the defendants to begin immediately to equalize the facilities. But the court sustained the validity of the contested provisions and denied the plaintiffs admission to the white schools during the equalization program. 98 F.Supp. 529. This Court vacated the District Court's judgment and remanded the case for the purpose of obtaining the court's views on a report filed by the defendants concerning the progress made in the equalization program. 342 U.S. 350, 72 S.Ct. 327, 96 L.Ed. 392. On remand, the District Court found that substantial equality had been achieved except for buildings and that the defendants were proceeding to rectify this inequality as well. 103 F.Supp. 920. The case is again here on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. s 1253, 28 U.S.C.A. s 1253. In the Virginia case, Davis v. County School Board, the plaintiffs are Negro children of high school age residing in Prince Edward County. They brought this action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools. Va.Const. s 140; Va.Code 1950, s 22--221. The three-judge District Court, convened under 28 U.S.C. ss 2281 and 2284, 28 U.S.C.A. ss 2281, 2284, denied the requested relief. The court found the Negro school inferior in physical plant, curricula, and transportation, and ordered the defendants forthwith to provide substantially equal curricula and transportation and to 'proceed with all reasonable diligence and dispatch to remove' the inequality in physical plant. But, as in the South Carolina case, the court sustained the validity of the contested provisions and denied the plaintiffs admission to the white schools during the equalization program. 103 F.Supp. 337. The case is here on direct appeal under 28 U.S.C. s 1253, 28 U.S.C.A. s 1253. In the Delaware case, Gebhart v. Belton, the plaintiffs are Negro children of both elementary and high school age residing in New Castle County. They brought this action in the Delaware Court of Chancery to enjoin enforcement of provisions in the state constitution and statutory code which require the segregation of Negroes and whites in public schools. Del.Const. Art. X, s 2; Del.Rev.Code, 1935, s 2631, 14 Del.C. s 141. The Chancellor gave judgment for the plaintiffs and ordered their immediate admission to schools previously attended only by white children, on the ground that the Negro schools were inferior with respect to teacher training, pupil-teacher ratio, extracurricular activities, physical plant, and time and distance involved in travel. Del.Ch., 87 A.2d 862. The Chancellor also found that segregation itself results in an inferior education for Negro children (see note 10, infra), but did not rest his decision on that ground. 87 A.2d at page 865. The Chancellor's decree was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Delaware, which intimated, however, that the defendants might be able to obtain a modification of the decree after equalization of the Negro and white schools had been accomplished. 91 A.2d 137, 152. The defendants, contending only that the Delaware courts had erred in ordering the immediate admission of the Negro plaintiffs to the white schools, applied to this Court for certiorari. The writ was granted, 344 U.S. 891, 73 S.Ct. 213, 97 L.Ed. 689. The plaintiffs, who were successful below, did not submit a cross-petition. **688 *487 In each of the cases, minors of the Negro race, through their legal representatives, seek the aid of the courts in obtaining admission to the public schools of their community on a nonsegregated basis. In each instance, *488 they have been denied admission to schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race. This segregation was alleged to deprive the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment. In each of the cases other than the Delaware case, a three-judge federal district court denied relief to the plaintiffs on the so-called 'separate but equal' doctrine announced by this Court in Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S.Ct. 1138, 41 L.Ed. 256. Under that doctrine, equality of treatment is accorded when the races are provided substantially equal facilities, even though these facilities be separate. In the Delaware case, the Supreme Court of Delaware adhered to that doctrine, but ordered that the plaintiffs be admitted to the white schools because of their superiority to the Negro schools. The plaintiffs contend that segregated public schools are not 'equal' and cannot be made 'equal,' and that hence they are deprived of the equal protection of the laws. Because of the obvious importance of the question presented, the Court took jurisdiction. [FN2] Argument was heard in the 1952 Term, and reargument was heard this Term on certain questions propounded by the Court. [FN3]},

abstract = {Recent work introduced the concept of NRGcoin [1] – a decentralized digital currency for renewable energy, based on Blockchain technology. In this abstract we summarize the con-cept and outline how this currency benefits each stakeholder in the smart grid and the renewable energy economy as a whole. The NRGcoin concept is visualized in Figure 1. When a prosumer generates energy and injects it in the grid (1), she receives information from the grid operator (2) on the balance of supply and demand in the micro-grid (or district). This in-formation is then used by the smart meter at that agent's home to securely create (3) (also issue, or " mint "), new digital units (or NRGcoins) for that prosumer. For every 1kWh of renewa-ble energy that the prosumer injects in the grid, her smart meter creates 1 NRGcoin. At any time, the prosumer can offer to sell her coins (4) on the NRGcoin currency market – a FOREX-type currency exchange. Consumers join the NRGcoin market and buy NRGcoins (5) using fiat currency, e.g. Euro, Dollar, Pound, etc. When consumers use green energy from the grid (6), their smart meter automatically pays for that consumption using NRGcoins (7), instead of traditional currency. 1 kWh green energy consumption from the grid costs 1 NRGcoin, regardless of the current retail cost of energy. Nevertheless, since NRGcoin is linked to energy, which in turn is linked to money, NRGcoin is indirectly linked to the monetary value of energy, unlike other digital currencies, such as Bitcoin, which are not linked to any particular value. Thus it is expected that NRGcoin will always fluctuate closely around the retail value of electricity. All digital transactions of NRGcoins, including their creation, are governed by the decentralized NRGcoin pro-tocol – a piece of software running on the peer-to-peer network of smart meters. This protocol is based on the Blockchain tech-nology [2]. Thus the NRGcoin concept offers a number of benefits to each stakeholder in the smart grid. It serves as:  a subsidy scheme for renewable installations with lower risk against policy change for prosumers. The issuance of the currency is governed by a decentralized protocol that can only be changed by a majority vote and thus not by in-dividual market actors.  a currency that offers consumers an alternative payment choice and cheaper green energy. High NRGcoin supply on the currency exchange market will drive NRGcoin price down, resulting in lower cost of green energy.  a financial tool offering faster cash flow and profit to re-tailers and grid operators. As a peer-to-peer currency, NRGcoin can process micro-payments, e.g. payments for energy every 15 minutes, at virtually zero overhead costs.  a mechanism that reduces the need for government support schemes, since prosumers are generating their own money, thus saving on budget.  an asset from which investors profit when electricity prices increase. Buying the currency at the current retail price of energy and selling at a later point will generate profits, as},

Our mechanism achieves demand response by providing incentives to prosumers to balance their production and consumption out of their own self-interest. All rewards and payments are carried out using NRGcoin - a new decentralized digital currency similar to Bitcoin, that we introduce in this paper. Prosumers exchange NRGcoins with fiat currency on an exchange market for profit, or for paying their energy bills. We study the advantages of our proposed currency over traditional monetary payment and explore its benefits for all parties in the smart grid.},

@article{CouncilGridWiseArchitecture2013,
abstract = {The motivations for transactive energy come from the increasing diversity of resources and components in the electric power system and the inability of existing practices to accommodate these changes. Expanded deployment of variable generation on the bulk power side, distributed energy resources throughout the system, and new intelligent load devices and appliances on the consumption side -- these all necessitate new approaches to how electric power is managed and delivered, and in the economic and business models involved. Conventional wisdom is that once variable generation resources reach 30{\%}, then the current control systems for the grid will be simply inadequate[5]. transactive energy provides a way to maintain reliability and security of the power system while increasing efficiency. These multiple goals pose a multi-objective control and optimization problem. This is one reason why transactive energy embraces both the economics and engineering of the power system. The same considerations outlined for the electric grid apply to building energy systems and other local energy systems such as microgrids[29]. In the past, these systems could be considered simply end nodes on the physical power grid that act as simple “dumb” loads. But they are becoming increasingly more interactive with the grid, providing intelligent load, storage, and generation sources. They now need to be considered integral and active components of the grid as a whole. Building energy systems account for a majority of the electric power consumed in the United States. From the grid perspective, they are candidates to become examples of loads that are integral, active components. Within buildings, the same need exists to achieve similar economic and reliably optimized solutions to manage energy. Asset owners, system operators, and other economic entities involved in the generation, transmission, and use of electric power all have a stake in a reliably efficient power system envisioned with transactive energy. There is a clear need to align value streams for all these parties with incentives for participation in an actively managed system. In this document, we describe the dimensions and basic elements for all stakeholders. This provides an opportunity for discussing how various approaches may enable alignment of value streams and the creation of sustainable business models. Regulatory, policy, and business issues frame the discussion about the functional characteristics of transactive energy systems. From these characteristics this report also presents a conceptual or reference architecture illustrating the principal functional entities and relationships. The intent of this material is not to define a specific solution but to describe the transactive energy environment and to enable comparisons among various approaches. The GridWise vision rests on the premise that information technology will revolutionize planning and operation of the electric power grid just as it has transformed business, education and entertainment. Information technology will form the “nervous system” that integrates new distributed technologies— demand response, distributed generation and storage—with traditional grid generation, transmission and distribution assets. Responsibility for managing the grid will be shared by a “society” of devices and system entities. The mission of the GridWise Architecture Council is to enable all elements of the electric system to interact. We are an independent body that believes tomorrow's electric infrastructure can be more efficient and secure by integrating information technology and e-commerce with distributed intelligent networks and devices. To achieve this vision of a transformed electric system, the GridWise Architecture Council is defining the principles for interaction among the information systems that will effectively and dynamically operate the grid. The Council, which is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, includes 13 representatives from electric energy generation and delivery, industrial systems control, building automation, information technology and telecommunications, and economic and regulatory policy.},

We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.},

abstract = {Smart contracts are programs that execute autonomously on blockchains. Many of their envisioned uses require them to consume data from outside the blockchain. (For example, a financial instrument might rely on a stock price.) Trustworthy *data feeds* that can support data requests by smart contracts will thus be critical to any smart contract system.We present an authenticated data feed system called Town Crier (TC). TC builds on the observation that many web sites, such as major news and finance sites, already serve as trusted data sources for non-blockchain uses. TC acts as a bridge between such servers and smart contract systems. It uses trusted hardware to authenticate and scrape data from HTTPS-enabled websites and to generate trustworthy data for relying smart contracts. It also includes a range of advanced features such as support for private data requests, which involve decryption and evaluation of request ciphertext within TC's hardware. We describe the TC architecture, its underlying trust model, and its applications, and report on an implementation that uses the newly released Intel SGX software development kit and furnishes data for the smart-contract system Ethereum. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first research paper reporting system implementation on a real SGX-enabled host. Finally, we present formal proofs of the security of TC, including correct handling of payment in Ethereum. We will soon be launching TC as an online public service.},

abstract = {As the Sharing Economy is emboldened by bitcoin and blockchain network peer-to-peer transaction processing, the virtuous cycle of efficiency of the Sharing Economy will be strengthened. The waste of fallow assets is reduced, and the related need for individual resource ownership declines. This increases the amount of discretionary budget and time available to consumers, and these newly available capital and time supplies may be applied to innovation, leisure, or other pursuits. As Bitcoin opens access to the global village of Internet-enabled commerce and collaborative consumption-based marketplaces, the noted impact multiplies. When the Sharing Economy at scale adapts to process transactions on the blockchain, the value of bitcoin and the blockchain is increased, and the adoption of Bitcoin grows. This further opens access to the Internet marketplace and to peer-to-peer transactions and sharing. Popular culture moves away from dependence on asset ownership and from the use of ownership to define self-identity.},

abstract = {—In the Internet of Things (IoT) scenario, the block-chain and, in general, Peer-to-Peer approaches could play an important role in the development of decentralized and data-intensive applications running on billion of devices, preserving the privacy of the users. Our research goal is to understand whether the blockchain and Peer-to-Peer approaches can be employed to foster a decentralized and private-by-design IoT. As a first step in our research process, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review on the blockchain to gather knowledge on the current uses of this technology and to document its current degree of integrity, anonymity and adaptability. We found 18 use cases of blockchain in the literature. Four of these use cases are explicitly designed for IoT. We also found some use cases that are designed for a private-by-design data management. We also found several issues in the integrity, anonymity and adaptability. Regarding anonymity, we found that in the blockchain only pseudonymity is guaranteed. Regarding adaptability and integrity, we discovered that the integrity of the blockchain largely depends on the high difficulty of the Proof-of-Work and on the large number of honest miners, but at the same time a difficult Proof-of-Work limits the adaptability. We documented and categorized the current uses of the blockchain, and provided a few recommendations for future work to address the above-mentioned issues.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed a thriving research activity on cooperative con- trol and motion coordination. This interest is motivated by the growing possibilities enabled by robotic networks in the monitoring of natural phe- nomena and the enhancement of human capabilities in hazardous and un- known environments. Our first objective in this book is to present a coherent introduction to basic distributed algorithms for robotic networks. This emerging discipline sits at the intersection of different areas such as distributed algorithms, par- allel processing, control, and estimation. Our second objective is to provide a self-contained, broad exposition of the notions and tools from these areas that are relevant in cooperative control problems. These concepts include graph-theoretic notions (connectivity, adjacency, and Laplacian matrices), distributed algorithms from computer science (leader election, basic tree computations) and from parallel processing (averaging algorithms, conver- gence rates), and geometric models and optimization (Voronoi partitions, proximity graphs). Our third objective is to put forth a model for robotic networks that helps to rigorously formalize coordination algorithms running on them. We illustrate how computational geometry plays an important role in modeling the interconnection topology of robotic networks. We draw on classical notions fromdistributed algorithms to provide complexitymeasures that characterize the execution of coordination algorithms. Such measures allow us to quantify the algorithm performance and implementation costs. Our fourth and last objective is to present various algorithms for coordina- tion tasks such as connectivity maintenance, rendezvous, and deployment. We especially emphasize the analysis of the correctness and of the complex- ity of the proposed algorithms. The technical treatment combines control- theoretic tools such as Lyapunov functions and invariance principles with techniques from computer science and parallel processing, such as induction and message counting.},

@article{Nakamoto2008,
abstract = {Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

abstract = {Blockchain is a decentralized transaction and data management technology developed first for Bitcoin cryptocurrency. The interest in Blockchain technology has been increasing since the idea was coined in 2008. The reason for the interest in Blockchain is its central attributes that provide security, anonymity and data integrity without any third party organization in control of the transactions, and therefore it creates interesting research areas, especially from the perspective of technical challenges and limitations. In this research, we have conducted a systematic mapping study with the goal of collecting all relevant research on Blockchain technology. Our objective is to understand the current research topics, challenges and future directions regarding Blockchain technology from the technical perspective. We have extracted 41 primary papers from scientific databases. The results show that focus in over 80{\%} of the papers is on Bitcoin system and less than 20{\%} deals with other Blockchain applications including e.g. smart contracts and licensing. The majority of research is focusing on revealing and improving limitations of Blockchain from privacy and security perspectives, but many of the proposed solutions lack concrete evaluation on their effectiveness. Many other Blockchain scalability related challenges including throughput and latency have been left unstudied. On the basis of this study, recommendations on future research directions are provided for researchers. {\textcopyright} 2016 Yli-Huumo et al.

abstract = {Traditionally, a commercial building's responsiveness to a demand response event is limited to actuation of the building HVAC and/or lighting system. However, current technological innovations allow for a more 'integrated' energy control system via the incorporation of plug-loads as actionable load. This paper outlines the software architecture of such a system to enable plug-loads as a demand response resource. Distributed local plug-load control is facilitated via the use of smart communicating power strips and Energy Information Gateways (EIGs), which bridge the gap between the central building controller an individual loads. Coordinated control of these distributed EIGs is accomplished via the central building controller, which receives and interprets external demand response signals and hosts a bidding process amongst the EIGs to meet the load shed criteria. The deployment of prototype systems based on this design architecture at UC Berkeley and the United States Air Force Academy will also be discussed. {\&}copy; 2013 IEEE.},

The average-based input in the objective is the only binding element. A dual splitting strategy enables the design of distributed and privacy preserving algorithms. Theoretical convergence bounds and numerical experiments show this method successfully applies to the problem of charging electric devices so as to even out the daily energy demand in California. The solution we provide is a privacy enforced algorithm readily implementable in a network of smart electric vehicle chargers. It can reach any arbitrary precision for the common optimization goal while relying on randomly perturbed information at the agent level. We show that, provided the community is large enough, an averaging effect enables the group to learn its global optimum faster than individual information is leaked. A limited number of messages are sent out in the distributed implementation which prevents adversary statisticians from having low theoretical Mean Square Errors for their estimates.},
